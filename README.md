Are you sick and tired of manually installing your favorite mod packs when your PC could be doing all the work?  
Introducing the Azura's Star Modding Tool!

## CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT. OLD TOOL IS LOCATED IN THE POWERSHELL BRANCH. OLD TOOL NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO REFLECT NEWEST ULTIMATE SKYRIM PATCH. I WILL DO THAT. EVENTUALLY
New tool will support all Automaton packs on release, creating your own modpacks, and editing existing MO2 mod instances. This tool isn't just for those who want to install a modpack, it is also invaluable to those who mod their own games.
## New Features
- SSE support.
- Modpack launcher.
- Create your own modpacks by patching Automaton .auto files to work with Azura's Star
- Import existing mod installs through MO2.
- Much more!
New tool will also include all features from the old tool.
