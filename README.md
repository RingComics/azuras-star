Are you sick and tired of manually installing your favorite mod packs when your PC could be doing all the work? Introducing the Azura's Star Modding Tool!

## Requirements

Only requirement is Windows 10. All other software is downloaded and installed during the modding process.

* Any step requiring human input gives you simple, detailed instructions on how to accomplish them
* Cleaning DLCs
* Installing and configuring ENB / ini files
* Downloading non-MO mods
* Installing SKSE
* Creates a desktop shortcut for your modlist. ModOrganizer never needs to be launched manually again!

* Template save now working
* Support for any Automaton modpack (COMING SOON)

## Usage

Simply download, extract, and run AzurasStar.exe.

## Development

PowerShell 5 or greater is required.

To speed up development on a secondary run, it is worth making a copy of any files downloaded, especially large ones.

#### Creating a release 

- Create an archive called `AzurasStar-[release].zip`
- Copy `src`, `License.md` and `README.md` into the archive (including the `src` folder)
- Create a new .exe using [this tool](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PS2EXE-GUI-Convert-e7cb69d5) and copy it into the archive.
- Create a release on GitHub
